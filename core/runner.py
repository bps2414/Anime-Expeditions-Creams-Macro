"""The macro's actual run loop -- Dashboard > Start. Currently covers the
launch sequence (confirm the task queue isn't empty, confirm we're on the
lobby screen, open Play > Story), picking the first task's map and stage,
Pre Start (camera setup, Team Loadout, a per-map default walk, the task's
Macro Operation template's Pre Start blocks), pressing Start Game, and then
watching the battle for Battle-phase blocks (Upgrade/Sell/Auto Upgrade Unit)
and a Victory/Defeat screen -- which gets its game stats (and, on a win, its
rewards) read via OCR, recorded to run history/win-loss counts, and reported
to Discord if a webhook is configured. Equipment include/exclude, and the
rest of the Battle-phase block types (Walk/Wait/Setting), plug in once those
