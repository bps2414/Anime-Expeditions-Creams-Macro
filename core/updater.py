"""Checks GitHub Releases for a newer tagged version than the one in VERSION,
and -- once the user confirms via the Dashboard's update popup -- applies it.
Two different update strategies depending on how the app is actually
running (see core.constants.IS_FROZEN), since "swap in the new files" means
something different in each case:

Running from Python source (dev / git clone): downloads the release's
SOURCE zip (GitHub generates one for any tag automatically) and robocopy's
it over the install dir, skipping anything the user owns (settings.json,
debug/, Paths/, Templates/, regenerated Assets -- same list .gitignore
excludes).

Running as a built exe (see build_pyinstaller.py): downloads the release
zip (the only binary asset a release publishes -- exe + Assets/ side by
side), extracts the new exe out of it, and swaps the exe file itself --
robocopying loose .py source over a compiled exe's directory wouldn't do
anything, the exe doesn't read scattered source files at runtime. The
batch-script swap choreography (wait for the old exe to actually exit,
move it aside, move the new one into place, relaunch, clean up) mirrors
the sibling Anime Squadron project's core.updater, which already solved
it -- ported here rather than re-solving it blind. The user-editable
Assets/ folder beside the exe is NEVER part of the swap -- an update
leaves it alone except for an add-only merge, from that same zip, of any
reference images that are new in the release (see the Assets section
below).

Either way: main.Api.apply_update stages the update, launches the relaunch
helper detached, THEN closes the app -- the helper doesn't touch any files
until this process (and its file handles) are actually gone.
