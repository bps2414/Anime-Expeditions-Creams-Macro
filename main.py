        window and is genuinely unusable in a ~500px strip, so it takes the

        window happened to be. resize() also defers onto the AppKit main thread
        (AppHelper.callAfter) while this runs on the JS-bridge/watchdog thread,
        hence the settle sleep before reading the result back.

        There is deliberately no AX fallback like the Windows path's

        on it fails with kAXErrorFailure (-25200), verified on a real Mac.
        setFrame_display_ (what pywebview calls) is not restricted that way,

        Records what the window ACTUALLY ended up at in _mac_panel_width, not
        what was asked for: that field is the short-circuit for repeat calls,
        so caching the requested width after a resize that silently did nothing
        would wedge the panel at the wrong size forever (every later call would
        match the cache and return early). On failure it is cleared to None,
